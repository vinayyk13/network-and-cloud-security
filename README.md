# Network and Cloud Security Projects

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on network and cloud security work developed through practical labs, simulations, and academic projects. The focus is on secure network design, risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, and applying security controls aligned with real-world enterprise environments.

The projects demonstrate an understanding of both **technical implementation** and **security reasoning**, rather than tool usage alone.

## Key Areas Covered

### Network Security
- Secure network topology design
- VLAN segmentation and access control
- Router and switch configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer)
- Firewall rules and basic ACL implementation
- Secure remote access concepts (VPN, SSH vs Telnet)
- Packet analysis using Wireshark
- Network reconnaissance and scanning using Nmap

---

### Cloud Security (Conceptual & Lab-Based)
- Cloud shared responsibility model
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) basics
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Cloud logging and monitoring fundamentals
- Introduction to SIEM concepts (Azure Sentinel – basic exposure)
- Common cloud threats and misconfigurations

---

### Risk Assessment & Vulnerability Analysis
- Threat identification and attack surface analysis
- Risk evaluation using likelihood and impact
- CVSS-based vulnerability scoring
- Mapping vulnerabilities to appropriate mitigations
- Security improvement recommendations

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- Azure (concept-level security labs)
- SIEM fundamentals
- TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, VLANs
